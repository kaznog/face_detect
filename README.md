# face_detect

face recognition YOLO detect MediaPipe hands and pose recognition

It must be referenced either by CMake or through a path.

 ðŸ“¸ 1. Capture the face of the person to be trained
 ```
    python .\capture_faces.py [person's name]  
 ```
    - If you want to train multiple people, run the command separately for each individual, specifying their name.
    - Photos will be saved under the faces directory, organized into subfolders named after each person.
    - Each capture session saves 10 images.
    If you need higher accuracy, repeat the capture process to double the training data to 20 images.

ðŸ§  2. Create the training dictionary using the captured photos
```
python .\make_pkl.py  
```
âœ… 3. Verify recognition using the trained model
```
python .\frecognizer.py  
```
